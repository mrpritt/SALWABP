## Abstract

 Assembly lines can be employed successfully in sheltered work centers to better include persons with disabilities in the labor market as well as to improve production efficiency. The optimal assignment of a heterogeneous work-force is known as the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem (ALWABP). These assembly lines are characterized not only by a heterogeneous work-force but also by high levels of absenteeism, which makes it more difficult to obtain stable and efficient line balancing solutions. In this paper an extension of the ALWABP to minimize the expected cycle time under uncertain worker availability is proposed. We model this problem as a two-stage mixed integer program, and propose local search heuristics for solving it. Computational experiments show that stochastic modeling can help to improve the line's efficiency and that the proposed heuristics produce good results for instances of practical size.
